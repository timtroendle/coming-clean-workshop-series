# coming clean — here is how I work {science edition}

This is a workshop series at REP/CP ETHZ where we share our ways of working. The workshop sessions are short and interactive; do not expect lecture style sessions or anything alike. The series is inspired by [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) and like pair programming its intend is to share information and best practises among people, but without the close collaboration of pair programming (which often simply does not exist for us).

Contribute by requesting a topic that you would like to hear more about or that you would like to discuss, or by suggesting a topic you could talk about. For a list of upcoming sessions see below.
